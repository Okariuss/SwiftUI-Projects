# ⏳ TimeScape — A SwiftUI Travel Map App

An elegant map-based **location discovery** app built with SwiftUI and modern `MapCameraPosition` API. Users can explore various places, view detailed previews, and transition smoothly across map regions — all within a beautiful SwiftUI interface powered by MVVM.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Dynamic map rendering using `MapCameraPosition`
- Tap-to-reveal location preview cards
- Detailed sheet view for each location
- “Next” button to cycle through locations with animation
- Automatic region adjustment when switching location
- MVVM pattern with `@Published` bindings
- Fully tested with **Swift Testing** framework (Swift 6.1.2)

---

## 🧪 Test Coverage

The project is covered with unit tests using the new `Testing` framework:

- `LocationTests.swift`:
  - Validates that the id property is generated by concatenating name and cityName
  - Confirms that two Location instances with the same id are considered equal (even if other fields different)
  - Ensures inequality for Location instances with different id values
- `LocationsViewModelTests.swift`:
  - Initializes with first location
  - Toggles location list visibility
  - Updates `mapCameraPosition` when location changes
  - Transitions to next location
  - Wraps to first location after reaching the end
