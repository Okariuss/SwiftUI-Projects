# SwiftUI Projects 🚀

A growing collection of open-source SwiftUI projects built from scratch.  
Each project demonstrates clean architecture (MVVM, Feature-based), best practices, and modular design.

## 🎯 Goals
- Learn by building real-world SwiftUI apps and Dribble UI challenges
- Explore animations, data handling, and modern iOS features
- Write clean, testable, reusable Swift code
